# SDEV140-Final
Final Project for SDEV140 by Maxim Tretyuk
YOU WILL NEED PYGAME MODULE FOR THE START_WINDOW TO PROPERLY WORK
This small app is a proof of concept and will allow you (the user) to pick one of the few listed within the program races from D&D 5E as well as a couple of the rogue classes and subclasses. It will then display to you all the information you will need for your character.
